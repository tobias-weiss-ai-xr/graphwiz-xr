# Chain-of-Thought templates for each persona
cot_templates:
  unit_test: |
    Let me think step by step about testing {function_name}:
    1. What does this function do?
    2. What are the valid inputs?
    3. What are the edge cases?
    4. What could go wrong?
    5. What assertions should I make?

  integration_test: |
    Let me think step by step about testing {system_flow}:
    1. Which services are involved?
    2. What is the expected data flow?
    3. What are the failure points?
    4. How should the system handle errors?
    5. What are the success criteria?

  security_test: |
    Let me think step by step about security implications of {component}:
    1. What are the attack vectors?
    2. What inputs can be manipulated?
    3. What are the authentication requirements?
    4. What sensitive data is exposed?
    5. How can I exploit potential vulnerabilities?
