## Technology Rationale

### Why TypeScript + Rust?

| Aspect           | Hubs (Legacy)            | GraphWiz-XR                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**     | JavaScript + A-Frame     | TypeScript + React Three Fiber          |
| **Backend**      | Elixir + Phoenix         | Rust + Actix-Web                        |
| **Performance**  | Good                     | Excellent (Rust zero-cost abstractions) |
| **Type Safety**  | Partial (Elixir dynamic) | Complete (TS + Rust)                    |
| **Bundle Size**  | Large (A-Frame deps)     | Optimized (tree-shaking)                |
| **WebGPU**       | Not available            | Ready for WebGPU migration              |
| **WebTransport** | Custom implementation    | Native HTTP/3 support                   |

### Architecture Improvements

- **Microservices**: Separate Rust services for better scalability
- **WebTransport**: Modern replacement for WebSocket for real-time data
- **React Three Fiber**: Declarative 3D with React ecosystem
- **Shared Protocol**: Protobuf definitions shared between TS and Rust
